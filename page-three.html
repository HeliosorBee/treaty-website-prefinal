          <h2>Reconciliaction</h2>
          <p>
            After 147 years the Nation of the Treaty 2 Territory and the
            Goversnment of Canada is committed to renewing the relationship.
            This renewal must be a nation-to-nation relationship – one based on
            recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership.
            (December 6, 2018)
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Protocol Agreement will help guide the parties as they work
            together to explore new ways to strengthen their treaty relationship
            and advance reconciliation based on shared goals and community
            priorities.

          <p>
            Meeceeing such event with the Chiefs and Minister Carolyn Bennett
            was Chief Norman Keeseekoowenin, who also sits as Vice-Chief of the
            First Nations in Treaty 2 Territory. Veteran James Eagle of the
            Skownan First Nation started off with a prayer to work together and
            renew relations.

            Chief Bone opened up by stating that we are here today to enter into
            a protocol with Canada that will guide discussions on various topics
            including a Renewed Relationship, Economic Self-sufficiency &
            Protecting our Territory, Territorial Governing, Treaty
            Implementation and Unfinished Treaty Business!

          <h2>Quotes From Renewal</h2>
          <p>
            “Today after 147 years, Treaty 2 and Canada are back at the table
            discussing the very important issues that we have. ‘Immigration and
            Settlement’ was the primary intent of the Treaty and now the real
            work begins to address our unfinished Treaty business. We are
            reclaiming our Rights and are in the process of rebuilding our
            nation. The people of Treaty 2 are establishing a contemporary
            government that will protect the land, water and resources in our
            territory. With the Protocol in place, we will move forward to not
            only reclaim our right to be self-determining, but rebuild our
            nation, as it was meant to be a 147 years ago.”
